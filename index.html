            <p>A kitten is a juvenile cat, born altricial and dependent on its mother, but developing quickly to become a playful and social animal. Kittens are typically born with eyes closed, opening them after seven to ten days, and they begin to eat solid food around four to five weeks of age. Proper care for a kitten includes providing food, water, a safe environment, and early socialization through play and human interaction. </p>
